 + Ferreira's Thesis
   #+begin_quote
   The main contribution of this thesis is educational material, capturing
   calculational and algorithmic problem-solving techniques, that supports the
   teaching of mathematics and computing. The material is problem-driven, it is
   aimed at the boundary between pre-university and university level...

   theory.

[[https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/lms/links/link_newedit.d2l?ext=0&linkid=97717&ou=347775][Using Z]] (Not equational, but uses the same notation as the above books; mostly.)

Z (pronouced "Zed") is a standardised mathematical notation intended for software specification.
For universal and existential quantification, CalcCheck uses the same notation as Z.

The first half of the book "Using Z" is an introduction to logic via natural deduction, and to basic discrete mathematics covering set, functions, and relations, all in the Z notation.

One of the products of the attempts to streamline mathematical arguments
mentioned above is the so-called calculational method, which aims at reducing
proofs as much as possible to elementary syntactic calculation. The
calculational proof style has been adopted widely by the community of computing
scientists working on formal pro- gramming methods. For example,

  [vG90],

  One of the first problems was that mathematicians hardly manipulate their formu- lae: instead, they interpret them; and one of the reasons is that the notation they use is not adequate for manipulation.

We cannot conclude this section without mentioning some of the efforts of the
mathe- matical community in articulating psychological and technical approaches
to problem solving. The best known work, and one of the major influences in
problem solving, is George P√≥lya‚Äôs How to Solve It. Even though other
mathematicians had considered questions of problem solving in earlier
generations, it was P√≥lya‚Äôs How to Solve It that had the tremendous impact on
the way people viewed the techniques of attacking mathematical problems. In
particular, it was there that P√≥lya suggested the division of the
problem-solving process into the now widely accepted four phases: understanding
the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. Other
works include Jacques Hadamard‚Äôs Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the
Mathematical Field, Karl Duncker‚Äôs On Problem Solving, and Max Wertheimer‚Äôs
Productive Thinking. Incidentally, all these books appeared in 1945, which led
Alan H. Schoenfeld to point out that 1945 was indeed a great year for problem
solving.

*Puzzle books*

Another trend in mathematics and problem solving ‚Äî and related with the opening quote of this chapter ‚Äî is based on the belief that mathematical games and recreations can be used for educational purposes and incorporated into various curricula

   kbd:Sep_8

   What is a calculational proof? What is discrete mathematics?
   How is math related to programming: ‚Äúproofs-as-programs‚Äù.

2. [[https://youtu.be/0wM0WXLJULQ][Grammatical Analysis and Boolean Operators]]
   kbd:Sep_10

   A proof is a ‚Äústory‚Äù, and calculation hints are the ‚Äútransitions‚Äù that make
   the story flow nicely.  The formulae are the ‚Äúsentences‚Äù and they are formed
   from operators, constants, and variables which act as ‚Äúverbs‚Äù, ‚Äúnames‚Äù, and
   ‚Äúpronouns‚Äù, respectively.

   ‚Ñïumber arithmetic is learned by memorising parts of
   infinitely large addition and multiplication tables.
   In contrast, ùîπoolean arithmetic has tiny 2√ó2 ‚Äútruth tables‚Äù.
   As such, ùîπ  may be easier to learn than ‚Ñï.

3. [[https://youtu.be/9oeJtu4JjSQ][Ladies and Tigers, a teaser]]
   kbd:Sep_11

   Continuing the discussion on Boolean operators and how they can be used to
   model puzzles.

4. [[https://youtu.be/7cmretG3Zzg][Substitution]]
    kbd:Sep_15

   Textual substitution is a way to implement function application, grafting on
   trees, and can be used for assignment commands in programming.

   kbd:Sep_17

   Update: There will be no knights and knaves problems in the upcoming Sep 22
   midterm; but possibly in a future midterm.

   The inference rules act as the foundational justification for the equational
   proof style; the online lecture notes go into more detail.

6. [[https://youtu.be/JxRZC2UMJb0][Inference rules, Proofs-are-programs, and Equivalence Part II]]
   (with lofi music) kbd:Sep_18

   Quickly show how a program can be shown to meet its specification,
   discuss equivalence and negation for the purposes of solving
   knights and knaves problems.

   kbd:Sep_22 is the first midterm; it is online during class time.

7. [[https://youtu.be/85MmBPp9jKc][Tabulation vs Calculation]] kbd:Sep_24

   We review basic operations on the Booleans with a focus on how manipulating
   symbols can be more effective than constructing truth tables, or evaluating
   expressions by ‚Äúplug and chug‚Äù simplifications.

   We also discuss formalisations of English phrases as propositional expressions.
